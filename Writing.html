	<h2>My life in Maine<h2>
	<p>I've lived in China Maine for my entire life in two different houses. I moved to my new house around the time
	I was starting kindergarten. I spent the rest of my middle school and high school years in that new house and now I 
	live here in Orono. I have a sister who is in her sixth year studying Physical Therapy at Husson. Both of my parents 
	are back in China. I also have a girlfriend who also lives in Orono. We've been together for over three years now. I've 
	always liked Maine and I have no desire to leave once I graduate. Maine is a beautiful state and I love where I live.</p>
